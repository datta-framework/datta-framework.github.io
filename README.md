This project will hold core solutions that are 60-100% complete. The goal is to create simple and powerful solutions that are reusable by design.

### [Jump Start Projects](/jump-start-projects)

These projects are 60-80% complete and serve as a core base for a solution. The repository for each project should be `forked` to your client ADO project.

* [Core SharePoint](/jump-start-projects/core-sp.md)
* [Dashboard](/jump-start-projects/dashboard.md)
* [Dashboard (VueJS)](/jump-start-projects/dashboard-vue.md)
* [Document Set Dashboard](/jump-start-projects/docset-dashboard.md)

#### How to Contribute?

Create a `branch` of the target project and submit a pull request. Create a new `branch` if a core solution does not exist. We are looking to grow this beyond **SharePoint**. Please help grow it.

* Power BI
* Power Platform
* PowerShell

### [Solutions](/solutions)

All solutions extend from a core jump start project. These projects are 80-100% complete and contain a JSON configuration. The solution assets are provided, so there is no need to compile your own version. If further customization is required, then the repository for each project can be `forked` to your client ADO project.
